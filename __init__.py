This is a prototype of cluster comparison code

'''

import sys

import astropy


# read two or more cluster catalogs
# what are the catalogs? 
# how to access catalogs name? config file? sys.argv? or equivalent?

# use astropy Table to read catalog content



# perform 2D RA, Dec match for a given configurable physical radius 
# (1 Mpc default)
# turn redshift in distance using cosmology (astropy.cosmology)
# astropy also for matches

# assess projection effects and miscentering (matplotlib)
# delta ra,dec distribution
# plot comparing photo-zs

# -------------------

# perform 3D RA, Dec, z match (configurable delta z)

# plot comparing richness
