'''
This is a prototype of cluster comparison code

'''

# read two or more cluster catalogs


# perform 2D RA, Dec match for a given configurable physical radius (Mpc)

# assess projection effects and miscentering
# plot comparing photo-zs

# perform 3D RA, Dec, z match (configurable delta z)

# plot comparing richness
